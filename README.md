# pasefRiQCalibrator
Welcome to the pasefRiQ calibrator! This simple tool allows you to apply a single one point calibration shift to a low mass region any standard MGF file. We use it to allow more accurate mass windows for the extraction of reporter ion signal.

To use this, download the zip file. Unzip it. Double click on the .EXE file. 
There are only 4 buttons in this GUI.
Pick your file.
Give it your manual calibration mass shift.
Tell it where you want it to stop applying the mass shift. I'm only using it up to 136 m/z to incorporate commercial reporter ions.
Hit the Calibrate Button!
Your new MGF file will show up in the folder where the .exe file is. Since the whole program is like 6 lines, I just copy the whole folder into where MSConvert put my MGF files.
